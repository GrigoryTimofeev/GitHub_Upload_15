# FinTech Module 15 Challenge: RoboAdvisor enchased by Amazon Lambda

In this activity, I created a Lex chabot intended to increase the client's portfolio and engage young people. Because machine learning and NLP are disrupting finance to improve the customer experience, I created a robo advisor. Both existing and potentially new customers will be able to use this robo advisor to get investment portfolio recommendations for retirement.
